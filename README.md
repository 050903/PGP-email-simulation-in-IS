# PGP Simulation Project

## Overview

This project is a simulation and visualization tool for understanding the PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) encryption process. It includes interactive HTML files and diagrams to help users learn about PGP workflows and updates.

## Features

- **PGP Simulation:** Demonstrates the process of encrypting and decrypting messages using PGP.
- **Workflow Visualization:** Provides a 3D diagram to illustrate the PGP workflow.
- **Update Tracking:** Includes an update page to keep track of changes and improvements.

## Project Structure

- `pgp-simulation/` — Contains the main simulation code and resources.
- `update.html` — A web page for displaying updates and changelogs.
- `workflow_3d_diagram.html` — An interactive 3D diagram visualizing the PGP workflow.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open `workflow_3d_diagram.html` or `update.html` in your web browser to explore the visualizations and updates.
3. Explore the `pgp-simulation` folder for the main simulation logic.

## Requirements

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)
